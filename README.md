# phd-thesis

This repository contains the source code for my Ph.D. thesis "Polarizability and magic-zero wavelength measurements of alkali atoms". 

I wrote and defended my thesis in the spring of 2013. I created this repo and added the files to github 2 years later. The thesis seemed to recompile correctly, but I don't promise that everything works perfectly.

Thanks to former UA Physics students Steve Steinke and Vincent Lonij for providing me with a good ``tex`` structure. Thanks also to the unknown people that developed the ``uathesis`` class.

All of the ``tex``, figures, and [``dissertation.pdf``](https://github.com/wholmgren/phd-thesis/blob/master/thesis/dissertation.pdf?raw=true) are in the [``thesis``](https://github.com/wholmgren/phd-thesis/tree/master/thesis) directory. The bibliography file contains far more entries than are in the thesis.

See my [atom-interferometry](https://github.com/wholmgren/atom-interferometry) repo for some of the analysis code used in my thesis.
